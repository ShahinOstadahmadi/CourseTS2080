It shows what it dos and not does. It also shows things a user can act on. Click on ... . It only

- High level function
- User point
- Set of actions (reffered to as Use Cases)

Visualise functional requierements

- Functional requiremenrts:

  - Does the thing effect the systems or how the user effect the system?

- Non-fucntional
  - Colors,backjround color

## Summerizing

- The purose of a use case is to define a piece of a coherent behavier without revealing the internal structure og the object

- Help visualize the fucntional req. of a system, including the relationship og the "actors" to the essential processess, as well as the relationship among different use cases.

- Further interactions can be defined as statechart diagrams, sequence diagram, communication diagrams, ot informal text descriptions. **Don`t crowd this diagram.**

# Pictures

- **System boundry**:

  - Defines the scope and limits of the system. it is shown as a rectangle that spans all use cases of the system.

- **Actors**: actor is an idealization of a role playes by an external person, prosess or thing. Acting on the system externaly

  - a stickman

- **Use case**: Oval shapes. Every business functionality is a potentioal use case. It should list the discrete business functionality specified in the problem statement.

- **Generalization:**

  - Generalization of an actor means that one actor can inherit the role of the other actor. The descendant has one or more use cases that are spesific to that role.
  - Arrow type

- associations: A-line between actors and use case . In complex diagrams, it is importatnt to know which actors are associated with whitch use cases.
