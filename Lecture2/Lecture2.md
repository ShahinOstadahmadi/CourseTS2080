# Introduction to UML

### What is UML

UML is different disiplines to communicate, here is some important points of view:

    . General-porpure visual modeling language. It is not spesific to onedomain. It general for systems.
    . Spescify, visualize, construc, and document the artifacts of a sowftware system
    . Decisions and understanding about systems must be constructed

    . Understanding, design, browse, donfigure, maintain, and control information about such systems

#### What in software design

In software design we use UML to communicate with thows who is effected by the software which we call stakeholders:

**Examples of stakeholders:**

- Investors
- Community who is affected
- Developers
- Other department within the company
- Others outide the company

### Is UML standard?

If there is software project where it takes 100 houres to complete the project with the software, How long would the system design take?

Thte "answere" is 300 hours.

After a project is started, it is usually very do a design overview with UML. So the main point is to try to be in the project as early as possible.

    - The UML does not define a standard process but is intended to be useful with an iterative development process.
    - Not programming language
    - UML is intended to be universal general-porpue modelling.

Risk: What happens if the software failed? It is important to know the consequenses to the industries.

### Benefits of UML

    - System handover
    - Quixck understandgin

## types of UML Diagrams

    - 14 types of Diagram

Structural: - What is it, how it is designed ->

Behave - What it does

Types of UML:

**Structural UML diagram**

    - Class diagram
    - etc

**Behavioral UML diagrams**

    - Use Diagram
    - Activity diagram
    - Sequence digram

"C4 UML Diagrams" - new stuff coming in the market

### Is it enforced? NO!

    - Was originally developt for OOP
    - 2005, UML 2.0 was introduced

    - Accepted concepts from many O.O methods
    - It is intended to model most application domains

#! Not a description of a detailed development process

UML Objectives

    -

Reverse engineering:
Explaning how some part of a system works without going through the detailed code. A thing you do before diving into the code.

Forward engineering:
UML as blueprint is about completeness. In forward engineering, blueprints are developed by a designer with detailed design for the programmer to code the system. The design should be complete in that all design decitions are laid out so the programmer should be able to follow the design straightforward that requires little thought.

Who is the designer:

    - Could be the programmer them self
    - Usually a more senior developer who designs for a team of developers

# Complexity og UML #1

## Complexity of UML #1

    • UML is a product of consensus of persons with varied goals and interests. It shares the qualities of the product of a democratic process.
    • It is not as clean or coherent as the product of a single will.
    •  It contains superfluous features (but different persons might disagree
    about precisely what is superfluous).
    • It contains overlapping features that are not always well integrated. Most of
    all, it lacks a consistent viewpoint.
    • Unlike a programming language, which has a fairly narrow usage, it is
    intended for all kinds of things, from business modeling to graphical
    programming.

    • There is a tension between concepts for conceptual modeling and
    programming language representation, with no consistent guidelines.
    • You don't have to know or use every feature of UML any more than you
    need to know or use every feature of a large software application or
    programming language.
    • It is unnecessary to listen too much to UML language lawyers. There is no single right way to use it.

UML is a tool that we can use. It is not everything

    - You cant take it literaly
    - Tension between concepts for conceptual modeling and programming lang. representation, with no consistent guidlines.
    - You only need to use what you need
    - It is unnecessary to listen too much to UML language lawyers. There is not a single right way to use it.

### Contradictions! Everywhere!

    . UML is more than a visual notations. UML models can be used to generate code and test cases.

### lecture focus

    - diagram
    - Use case diagram
    - Activity diagram
    - Class Diagram

# OO Analysis and Design

For the history sake. This method is not working today.

    - Identify allt the objects in the system
        - Big job
        - You are assuming objects
        - Waterfall method thinking
    - Define relationship
    - Establish interface
    - Making the design executable

Agile, scrum is new models.
